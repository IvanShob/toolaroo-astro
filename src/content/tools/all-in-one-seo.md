whoIsItFor: "All in One SEO (AIOSEO) is designed for WordPress site owners, bloggers, and small business teams who want thorough SEO coverage without a steep learning curve. It particularly suits users who want to do everything from one plugin without installing multiple separate SEO tools — covering on-page, local, WooCommerce, and schema SEO in a single install. Users who find Yoast or Rank Math too complex will appreciate AIOSEO's cleaner setup wizard."
longDescription: "All in One SEO (AIOSEO) is one of the most widely used WordPress SEO plugins, having been installed on over 3 million websites since its original release in 2007. It provides comprehensive on-page SEO optimization, technical SEO management, schema markup, local business SEO, WooCommerce product optimization, and link management — making it a full-spectrum SEO solution that rivals much of what dedicated SEO platforms offer, all within the WordPress dashboard.\n\nAIOSEO's setup wizard is one of its most valued features for beginners. A guided onboarding process asks about site type, business category, and optimization priorities, then automatically configures recommended settings — eliminating the overwhelming blank-slate experience that causes many users to misconfigure competitor plugins. This intelligent defaults approach means sites can be properly SEO-configured from day one without requiring SEO expertise.\n\nThe plugin's on-page analysis scores each post and page across multiple ranking factors including keyword placement, meta description quality, heading structure, image alt text, internal links, and readability. Unlike simpler plugins that show a single pass/fail indicator, AIOSEO provides itemized actionable checks that tell writers exactly what to fix and why. The TruSEO Score gives content teams a consistent quality benchmark across all published content.\n\nAIOSEO's schema markup generator supports over 20 schema types including articles, local businesses, products, recipes, events, FAQs, and how-to structured data — with an intuitive interface that doesn't require JSON-LD knowledge. The Local SEO module manages business information, opening hours, and Google Maps integration for businesses with physical locations. WooCommerce SEO extends the plugin's optimization features to product pages, categories, and shop schemas, making it a one-stop solution for e-commerce sites on WordPress. The link assistant tool audits internal links across the entire site and suggests relevant linking opportunities — a capability typically found only in premium SEO platforms."
