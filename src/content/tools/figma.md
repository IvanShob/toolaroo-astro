whoIsItFor: "Figma is the go-to tool for UI/UX designers, product teams, and design system managers at companies of any size who need collaborative, browser-based design with professional-grade component systems and developer handoff. It is especially valuable for product designers working closely with developers, and for teams building and maintaining large-scale design systems across multiple products."
longDescription: "Figma is the industry-leading collaborative interface design tool used by millions of designers, developers, and product teams worldwide. What started as a web-based design tool has evolved into a comprehensive design platform with AI-powered features, real-time collaboration, prototyping, design systems, and developer handoff — all accessible from any browser without requiring software installation.\n\nFigma AI (available in all paid plans) brings intelligent automation to the design workflow. It can generate placeholder text, automatically rename and organize layers, create multiple design variations from a single prompt, translate UI text, and suggest responsive layout adjustments. The platform integrates with hundreds of community AI plugins for generating images, icons, and copy directly within Figma files.\n\nFigma's real-time collaborative nature fundamentally changes how design teams work. Multiple designers can edit the same file simultaneously, seeing each other's cursors and leaving inline comments. FigJam, Figma's whiteboarding tool, extends collaboration to brainstorming, user journey mapping, and planning sessions — combining sticky notes, flowcharts, and diagrams in a shared digital canvas.\n\nDesign systems are where Figma's component architecture shines. Teams build shared component libraries with variants, interactive states, and Auto Layout rules — ensuring every designer works with the same building blocks and design changes propagate automatically across all screens. This systematic approach dramatically reduces inconsistency and accelerates large-scale design operations.\n\nWith Dev Mode, developers inspect design files to read exact spacing, typography, and color values, and copy production-ready CSS, Swift, or Android code directly from any design element. This replaces the traditional redline annotation process and reduces back-and-forth between design and engineering. Figma's position at the intersection of design and development makes it the standard tool for modern product teams at companies of all sizes."
