longDescription: "You.com is an AI-native search engine that blends real-time web search with conversational AI assistance, creating a research experience that goes significantly beyond what traditional search engines or standalone AI chatbots offer separately. Rather than returning a list of blue links or generating responses from static training data alone, You.com queries the live web, synthesises information from multiple sources, and presents answers with clear citations — giving users both the answer and the ability to verify it.\n\nThe platform is organised around several distinct AI modes. Smart mode handles general AI-assisted search with cited web results, functioning like a research assistant that reads pages on your behalf and summarises the most relevant findings. YouCode is a dedicated mode for software developers — it provides coding assistance, code generation, debugging help, and technical documentation lookups with awareness of current library versions and up-to-date syntax. YouImagine allows users to generate AI images from text prompts using multiple underlying models, while YouWrite supports content drafting and writing assistance within the same interface.\n\nOne of You.com's most appreciated design choices is its transparency around sources. Every AI-generated response includes inline citations linking to the specific web pages used to construct the answer. Users can click through to verify claims, read the original source, and assess credibility — a significant advantage over AI tools that generate confident-sounding responses without grounding them in traceable references. This makes You.com particularly well-suited for research tasks where accuracy and source verification are critical.\n\nYou.com has positioned itself as a privacy-respecting alternative to Google, offering a no-tracking search experience alongside its AI capabilities. Its multimodal approach — combining search, coding, writing, and image generation in a single interface — reduces the need to switch between multiple tools during a research or content creation workflow. With a competitive free tier and a Pro plan that unlocks more powerful AI models, You.com offers strong value for knowledge workers, researchers, students, and developers."
