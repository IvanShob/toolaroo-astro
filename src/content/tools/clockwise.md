whoIsItFor: "Clockwise is ideal for knowledge workers and distributed teams using Google Calendar who struggle with fragmented schedules and constant meeting interruptions. Engineering teams, product teams, and cross-functional groups who want to protect focus time without constant manual calendar management will benefit most. It is particularly powerful when adopted team-wide, as it optimizes schedules with awareness of everyone's preferences simultaneously."
longDescription: "Clockwise is an AI-powered calendar optimization platform designed to solve one of the most pervasive problems in modern knowledge work: calendars so fragmented by back-to-back meetings that there is no continuous time left for focused, deep work. By analyzing Google Calendar events and applying intelligent scheduling rules, Clockwise automatically rearranges flexible meetings into clusters, protects continuous Focus Time blocks, and coordinates meeting availability across entire teams.\n\nThe platform's core intelligence lies in its ability to distinguish between fixed events (meetings that cannot move) and flexible events (meetings that could occur at various times). For flexible meetings, Clockwise finds the time slot that best preserves Focus Time for all attendees, considering their individual preferences and work hour settings. Over time, this results in calendars with longer uninterrupted work blocks rather than a patchwork of 30-minute gaps between meetings.\n\nFocus Time is Clockwise's primary protected resource. Each user can set a goal for how many hours of Focus Time they want per day, and Clockwise will actively defend those blocks from meeting incursions where possible. When someone requests a meeting, Clockwise's scheduling assistant finds times that fit the participants' calendars without fragmenting their protected work sessions. Slack status integration automatically sets users as busy or in Focus Time based on their Clockwise calendar state, reducing interruptions without manual status updates.\n\nFor engineering and product teams, Clockwise's team analytics provide visibility into how meeting load, Focus Time, and collaboration patterns are distributed across the organization. Managers can see whether certain team members are overloaded with meetings, identify days where the team has strong overlap for synchronous collaboration, and track whether improvements in scheduling policies are translating into more productive calendar patterns. With a free plan covering individuals and affordable team pricing, Clockwise offers strong value for knowledge worker teams committed to protecting the time that serious work requires."

  - question: "Does Clockwise improve if my whole team uses it?"
    answer: "Yes — Clockwise is significantly more powerful when used team-wide. It can then optimize everyone's calendar simultaneously, finding meeting times that protect focus blocks for all participants rather than just one."
  - question: "Does Clockwise integrate with Slack?"
    answer: "Yes — Clockwise syncs your Slack status with your calendar, automatically setting you as 'In a meeting' or 'Focusing' based on your current schedule, reducing interruptions without manual status changes."
