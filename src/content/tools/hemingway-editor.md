whoIsItFor: "Hemingway Editor is ideal for bloggers, content writers, journalists, and business communicators who want to make their writing more clear, direct, and reader-friendly. It particularly suits writers who tend to over-explain, use passive voice frequently, or write complex multi-clause sentences. Non-native English speakers polishing professional writing and marketers striving for punchy, conversion-focused copy will find it a useful addition to their workflow."
longDescription: "Hemingway Editor is a writing clarity tool inspired by Ernest Hemingway's famously direct, precise prose style. Rather than fixing grammar or checking spelling, Hemingway focuses entirely on making writing simpler, bolder, and easier to read — highlighting the specific patterns that make text unnecessarily complex and giving writers immediate visual feedback on where to cut and clarify.\n\nThe tool analyzes pasted or typed text and color-codes different types of problems. Yellow highlights mark complex sentences that are difficult to read. Red highlights indicate sentences so dense that even the most determined reader will struggle. Purple highlights show words that have simpler synonyms. Blue highlights flag adverbs, encouraging writers to replace weak verb-adverb combinations with a single strong verb. Green highlights identify passive voice constructions, prompting active, direct replacements.\n\nThe right sidebar displays a Readability Grade — a Flesch-Kincaid score indicating the approximate education level needed to easily read the text. For most web content, a Grade 6–8 score is ideal, ensuring accessibility across diverse audiences. The sidebar also shows word count, sentence count, and the number of highlighted issues by category, giving writers a clear target for each editing pass.\n\nHemingway Editor is deliberately simple — it does not suggest alternative phrasings, generate AI rewrites, or check grammar. This is both its strength and its limitation. Users must make every editorial decision themselves, which some writers prefer as it forces deeper engagement with the text. The web version is free and requires no account, making it instantly accessible for quick editing sessions. The desktop app adds offline functionality and direct export to Word, PDF, and WordPress. While Hemingway is not a complete writing assistant, it teaches a style of writing clarity that improves with every editing session."

faqItems:
  - question: "Is Hemingway Editor free?"
    answer: "Yes — the web version at hemingwayapp.com is completely free with no account required. The desktop app is available as a one-time $19.99 purchase for offline use."
  - question: "Does Hemingway Editor use AI?"
    answer: "No — Hemingway Editor uses rule-based linguistic analysis rather than AI. It does not generate suggestions; it only highlights patterns in your text for you to manually improve."
  - question: "What readability grade should I aim for?"
    answer: "For most web content and business writing, a Grade 6–9 score is optimal. This ensures accessibility across diverse reading levels. Academic or technical content can sit higher if the audience expects it."
  - question: "Why does Hemingway flag passive voice?"
    answer: "Passive voice often creates vague, wordy sentences where active voice would be clearer and more direct. 'The report was written by the team' is weaker than 'The team wrote the report.' Hemingway flags passive constructions to encourage more direct expression."
  - question: "Can I write in Hemingway Editor, or just paste?"
    answer: "You can write directly in the Hemingway Editor web app or the desktop application, with real-time highlighting as you type. Many writers paste from another tool for a final edit pass."
  - question: "Does Hemingway check grammar?"
    answer: "No — Hemingway focuses exclusively on clarity, readability, and style. For grammar checking, tools like Grammarly should be used alongside Hemingway."
