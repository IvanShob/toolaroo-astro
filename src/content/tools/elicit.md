longDescription: "Elicit is an advanced AI-powered research assistant created by Ought, designed to help researchers, students, and professionals save time when working with academic literature. Instead of manually searching for papers, reading dense abstracts, and extracting insights, Elicit uses machine learning to automate the most time-consuming parts of the research process.\n\nUnlike traditional tools that simply return a list of links, Elicit focuses on research workflows. When you enter a question, it finds relevant papers, extracts key information (such as methodology, outcomes, limitations, and sample sizes), and presents everything in an organised, structured format. This makes it an extremely powerful tool for literature review preparation.\n\nElicit's strength comes from its ability to perform semantic search, meaning it understands concepts — not just keywords. For example, if you ask, \"Does meditation improve focus?\" it will not only find studies that explicitly mention \"meditation\" and \"focus\" but also related terms, synonyms, and conceptually relevant findings.\n\nOne of Elicit's standout capabilities is its ability to extract study-level insights. It analyses academic papers to summarise research questions, methodologies, participants, results, and limitations. This saves researchers countless hours that would normally be spent reading each paper manually. Whether you're working on a university thesis, conducting policy analysis, or evaluating scientific claims, Elicit accelerates the process significantly."
