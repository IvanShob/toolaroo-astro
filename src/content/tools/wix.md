whoIsItFor: "Wix is ideal for small business owners, entrepreneurs, freelancers, and individuals who need a professional website without technical expertise or a development budget. It works best for service businesses, restaurants, photographers, and local companies wanting an attractive, functional website they can manage themselves. People who prioritize ease of use and a quick path to a live website over custom design control will find Wix the most accessible option."
longDescription: "Wix is one of the most widely used website builders in the world, with over 250 million registered users who rely on it to create professional-looking websites without writing a single line of code. Since its launch in 2006, Wix has continuously evolved from a basic drag-and-drop builder into a comprehensive website creation platform with AI-powered design capabilities, e-commerce tools, booking systems, and a rich ecosystem of apps and integrations.\n\nWix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence) is the platform's AI-powered website creation feature. When a new user registers, they answer a series of questions about their business type, preferred style, and content needs — and Wix ADI generates a fully designed, content-populated website in seconds. The generated site uses real content structure appropriate for the business type and applies design choices consistent with stated preferences. Users can then edit the AI-generated site using the standard Wix Editor, customize every element, or switch to the more advanced Wix Studio for professional-level control.\n\nWix's template library contains over 900 professionally designed templates covering virtually every business category — restaurants, salons, photographers, fitness studios, online stores, portfolios, and more. Each template is fully customizable through the visual editor, allowing users to change colors, fonts, layouts, and content without any CSS or HTML knowledge. The responsive design system ensures sites look appropriate on desktop, tablet, and mobile without manual adjustment.\n\nFor businesses needing e-commerce, Wix Stores provides a complete online shopping solution including product listings, inventory management, multiple payment gateways, shipping calculations, and order management — all within the same Wix platform as the website itself. Wix Bookings extends this to appointment-based businesses, while Wix Restaurants handles online ordering and table reservations. The App Market offers hundreds of additional integrations including email marketing, live chat, analytics, and CRM tools."

  - question: "Can I transfer my Wix website to another platform?"
    answer: "Wix websites cannot be exported and migrated to another platform — your site content is locked within the Wix ecosystem. This is a significant consideration if you might want to move to Webflow, WordPress, or a custom solution in the future."
