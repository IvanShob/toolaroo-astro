longDescription: "Spline AI is a cutting-edge 3D design platform that empowers designers, developers, and creators to build interactive 3D content for digital projects. Its intuitive interface allows anyone, regardless of coding experience, to design complex 3D objects, scenes, and animations that can be embedded directly into websites, apps, or presentations.\n\nThe platform combines AI-driven automation with manual control, providing users the flexibility to adjust shapes, lighting, textures, and camera angles. Designers can work from scratch or import models to manipulate and animate in real-time. Spline AI's interactive features allow users to create dynamic web experiences, including hover effects, click interactions, and 3D transitions, enhancing user engagement and storytelling.\n\nSpline AI stands out because it bridges the gap between traditional 2D web design and immersive 3D experiences. Its export options allow embedding into standard web projects via WebGL or other interactive frameworks, making it accessible for developers and designers alike. The tool also supports collaboration, enabling teams to co-create 3D content and iterate quickly.\n\nWhether you are creating product visualizations, interactive presentations, marketing campaigns, or educational content, Spline AI streamlines the 3D creation workflow. Its combination of ease-of-use, AI-assisted modeling, and real-time interactivity makes it ideal for professionals and hobbyists looking to elevate their digital presence with immersive 3D experiences."
