whoIsItFor: "Anima is ideal for web designers and UX professionals who want to bridge the gap between Figma design and frontend development without writing code themselves. Design agencies that need to deliver interactive prototypes or frontend starters to development teams, and startups looking to accelerate their design-to-launch timeline, will find Anima's combination of code generation and prototype publishing particularly valuable."
longDescription: "Anima is a design-to-code and prototype publishing platform that operates as a Figma plugin and standalone service, allowing designers to convert visual designs into working code and publish interactive prototypes without requiring development resources. It bridges the historically problematic handoff between design and engineering by generating clean, component-based React, HTML/CSS, and Vue code directly from Figma artboards.\n\nThe platform's code generation analyzes Figma layer structure, styles, and components, then produces frontend code that reflects the design's visual intent as closely as possible. Auto-layout detection converts Figma frame structures into appropriate flexbox or grid CSS layouts, while component identification creates reusable React or Vue components from repeated design elements. Design tokens including colors, typography, and spacing values are extracted and mapped to code-level variables, maintaining alignment between the design system and the codebase.\n\nAnima's prototype publishing feature is a powerful complement to its code generation. Designers can publish interactive Figma prototypes to a hosted URL with auto-animated transitions, hover states, and click interactions working as defined in Figma — making them shareable with stakeholders and usable in user testing sessions without requiring a developer to build a functional frontend first. This dramatically shortens the feedback loop between design and client or user validation.\n\nFor teams using Figma's design system features, Anima's sync capability allows design token updates to propagate into previously generated code, keeping design and development in closer alignment during iterative product development. The platform's free plan covers prototype publishing and basic code inspection, while paid plans unlock full code generation, team features, and custom domain publishing. For design agencies and product teams seeking to reduce the design-to-development gap, Anima offers a practical bridge that accelerates delivery without requiring designers to become developers."

faqItems:
  - question: "Does Anima generate production-ready code?"
    answer: "Anima generates a clean structural and component foundation from Figma designs. Developers should review and extend the output, particularly for business logic, API integrations, and complex interactions."
  - question: "What frameworks does Anima support?"
    answer: "Anima currently supports React, HTML/CSS, and Vue code generation, covering the most widely used frontend frameworks."
  - question: "Is Anima free to use?"
    answer: "Anima has a free plan that covers prototype publishing and basic code inspection. Full code generation and multiple projects require a paid Pro plan."
  - question: "How does Anima compare to Locofy?"
    answer: "Both convert Figma designs to code. Anima has a stronger prototype publishing feature for client presentations. Locofy has better design system sync and GitHub direct export for development workflows."
  - question: "Can I publish prototypes with Anima without a subscription?"
    answer: "Yes — Anima's free plan includes prototype publishing to a hosted Anima URL, allowing interactive Figma prototypes to be shared with stakeholders without a paid subscription."
  - question: "Does Anima work inside Figma?"
    answer: "Yes — Anima is available as a Figma plugin, allowing designers to generate code and publish prototypes directly from within their Figma workflow without switching to a separate application."
