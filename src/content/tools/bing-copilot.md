whoIsItFor: "Bing Copilot is ideal for everyday users who want AI-powered search with source citations built into their browser and Windows experience. It particularly suits Microsoft 365 users, Windows users who prefer a search-integrated AI experience, and professionals who want quick AI assistance without switching to a separate app. People who use Edge as their primary browser will find Bing Copilot the most seamlessly integrated AI research option."
longDescription: "Bing Copilot is Microsoft's AI-powered conversational search assistant, built on OpenAI's GPT-4 technology and integrated deeply into Bing search, Microsoft Edge, and Windows. It combines the natural language understanding of large language models with real-time Bing web search, producing answers that are grounded in current web content with transparent source citations — addressing the hallucination problem that affects AI models relying purely on training data.\n\nThe assistant is accessible through multiple entry points: the Bing search results page, a dedicated Copilot.microsoft.com portal, the Edge browser sidebar, and Windows 11's Copilot system panel. This multi-surface integration means Bing Copilot is available at the moment of need without requiring a separate app or subscription — a significant advantage over standalone AI tools for users already in the Microsoft ecosystem.\n\nBing Copilot's conversation modes offer flexibility for different tasks. The Balanced mode prioritizes accurate, well-sourced responses. Creative mode allows more expressive and imaginative outputs for writing assistance. Precise mode focuses on factual accuracy for research and technical questions. Each response includes numbered source citations that users can click to verify information directly at the originating page — creating an audit trail that helps evaluate the reliability of AI-generated answers.\n\nFor Microsoft 365 subscribers, Copilot extends beyond web search into productivity applications. Microsoft Copilot in Word drafts documents, Microsoft Copilot in Excel analyzes data, and Microsoft Copilot in Teams summarizes meetings — creating a unified AI assistant across the entire Microsoft productivity suite. The free Bing Copilot tier provides generous access to the GPT-4-powered chatbot without subscription requirements, making it one of the most accessible high-quality AI assistants for general users who want cited, web-grounded answers."
