longDescription: "Frase is an AI-powered content research and writing tool that helps SEO professionals and content marketers create better-ranking content faster. Its core differentiator is in content research — it analyzes the top 20 search results for any target keyword and condenses competitive insights into a comprehensive content brief that writers can execute without deep SEO expertise.\n\nThe AI content brief shows writers exactly what topics, questions, and heading structures the top-ranking content covers, providing a clear blueprint for comprehensive, authoritative articles. This research-first approach ensures writers understand the full semantic scope of a topic before drafting a single word — a fundamental shift from the traditional workflow of writing first and optimizing afterward. The brief also surfaces 'People Also Ask' questions from Google, giving writers a built-in FAQ structure that targets featured snippet opportunities.\n\nFrase's integrated AI writer uses the research to generate sections of the article directly within the editor. Rather than generic AI writing that ignores ranking context, Frase's AI is informed by what's already working in the SERP — producing topic-relevant prose rather than generic content. The real-time content optimization score updates as you write, comparing your coverage of relevant topics against the top competitors.\n\nContent audit functionality allows teams to identify existing articles that have declined in rankings and need refreshing. Frase analyzes what the current top-ranking pages cover that the existing article doesn't, generating a prioritized list of additions and improvements. This update workflow is often more cost-effective than writing new articles and can quickly recover lost traffic from pages that have fallen in the rankings.\n\nFrase's API and Zapier integration enable workflow automation for content teams — triggering brief creation from keyword inputs, routing completed briefs to writers, and tracking content performance across large content operations. Team collaboration features allow multiple contributors to share and annotate the same research brief, ensuring everyone works from the same strategic foundation."
