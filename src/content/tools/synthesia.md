longDescription: "Synthesia is one of the most widely used AI video generation tools on the market, best known for its ability to transform written scripts into fully produced videos featuring lifelike AI presenters. Designed for businesses, educators, and marketing teams, the platform makes video creation accessible to anyone—no filming, equipment, or video production experience required.\n\nAt the core of Synthesia is its library of AI avatars, digital presenters modelled from real actors. These avatars can speak hundreds of languages, deliver content with natural expressions, and maintain consistent branding. Users simply type or paste a script, choose an avatar, pick a background or template, and Synthesia generates a polished video in minutes. This dramatically reduces both cost and production time compared to traditional filming.\n\nSynthesia has become especially popular in corporate training, onboarding, e-learning, product walkthroughs, and internal communications. Instead of recording instructors or executives each time a process changes, teams can instantly update the video by modifying the script. This makes Synthesia ideal for scalable, repeatable content that needs frequent revisions.\n\nThe platform offers more than just AI presenters. With features like text overlays, screen recordings, background music, branded templates, and multi-slide video structuring, it functions as a lightweight but highly efficient editing environment. Users can build entire presentations, tutorials, or explainer videos within a single workflow."
