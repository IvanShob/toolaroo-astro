longDescription: "Cursor is a next-generation AI code editor built specifically for developers who want deeper AI integration than traditional IDE plugins can offer. Instead of being \"just an autocomplete tool,\" Cursor acts as a full collaborative coding partner — capable of understanding your entire codebase, generating new features, fixing bugs, refactoring files, analyzing architecture, and automating large-scale changes.\n\nWhat makes Cursor fundamentally different from tools like GitHub Copilot is its editor-first approach. Cursor is built around AI from the ground up, meaning the entire interface, workflows, and features are optimized for natural-language coding. Developers can select code, highlight files, or provide high-level instructions, and Cursor will intelligently modify the project with an understanding of structure, context, dependencies, and style conventions.\n\nThe editor includes a powerful command interface — \"Ask Cursor\" — where you can request anything from implementing a feature to optimizing performance or generating documentation. Cursor's multi-file reasoning allows it to scan and understand complex projects, making it capable of generating coherent, large-scale updates rather than isolated suggestions.\n\nCursor's strengths shine especially in tasks that typically require significant engineering time: large refactors, framework migrations, bug tracing, and writing entire modules or components. Its built-in diff viewer makes changes transparent — developers can approve or reject edits before they are applied. This gives full control while dramatically accelerating output.\n\nWith support for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, React, Node.js, and dozens of other languages, Cursor adapts to modern development stacks seamlessly. Thanks to its deep contextual awareness, it helps maintain coding style consistency, improves readability, and reduces the risk of errors introduced during manual development.\n\nCursor also includes powerful memory and context features: it remembers past prompts, understands dependencies across files, and keeps high-level goals in mind as you work. This makes the experience more like working with an intelligent engineering partner than a simple autocomplete tool.\n\nFor teams, Cursor can access private repositories, follow architectural guidelines, and generate code aligned with organizational standards. It improves developer onboarding by allowing new engineers to ask questions such as \"How does authentication work here?\" and receive detailed explanations with file references.\n\nOverall, Cursor is a transformative coding environment designed for speed, clarity, and AI-enhanced productivity. For developers who want a more dynamic and intelligent workflow, Cursor offers one of the most powerful AI-first coding experiences available today."

faqItems:
  - question: "Does Cursor replace Copilot?"
    answer: "Not exactly — Cursor is an editor, while Copilot is an autocomplete assistant. Many use both."
  - question: "Does Cursor understand entire projects?"
    answer: "Yes, it can analyze multiple files and connections across your codebase."
  - question: "Is Cursor good for beginners?"
    answer: "Yes — it explains code, fixes bugs, and guides learning."
  - question: "Does Cursor work offline?"
    answer: "No, AI features require internet access."
  - question: "Is Cursor based on VS Code?"
    answer: "Yes — Cursor is built on top of VS Code, so it supports the same extensions, themes, keybindings, and workflows that VS Code users are already familiar with."
  - question: "What programming languages does Cursor support?"
    answer: "Cursor supports all languages that VS Code supports, including Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, C++, and many others."

whoIsItFor: Cursor is ideal for developers who want a fundamentally AI-native coding experience rather than a plugin layered onto an existing editor — particularly those building full-stack applications, working with large codebases, or executing complex refactors. It is especially valuable for senior engineers and engineering leads who need to make broad structural changes across many files efficiently, and for startup founders and indie developers who want to prototype and ship features significantly faster. Developers comfortable with VS Code will find Cursor's familiar interface easy to adopt while gaining dramatically more powerful AI-assisted capabilities.
