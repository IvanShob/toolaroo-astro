whoIsItFor: "Google Scholar is essential for students, researchers, academics, and professionals who need to find scholarly sources for papers, reports, and evidence-based decisions. It works best for anyone conducting traditional academic searches where breadth of coverage matters more than AI-powered synthesis. Graduate students and independent researchers who need free access to the academic literature will rely on it daily."
longDescription: "Google Scholar is the world's most widely used academic search engine, providing free access to an enormous index of scholarly literature spanning virtually every academic discipline. Launched by Google in 2004, Scholar indexes journal articles, conference papers, theses, dissertations, book chapters, preprints, and technical reports from university repositories, academic publishers, and research institutions worldwide. It has become the de facto starting point for academic research across education, science, law, medicine, and the humanities.\n\nThe platform's search algorithm is designed specifically for academic content, ranking results based on citation count, publication venue relevance, and the authority of the publishing institution. This citation-aware ranking helps researchers surface foundational, highly cited papers rather than simply returning the most recent publications — a critical distinction when conducting thorough literature reviews. Each search result displays the total citation count with a link to citing articles, enabling researchers to trace the scholarly conversation around any given finding.\n\nGoogle Scholar's 'Cited By' feature is one of its most powerful capabilities. Clicking on a paper's citation count reveals all papers that have since referenced it, making it possible to trace how ideas have evolved across the literature and discover more recent work building on foundational studies. The 'Related Articles' feature uses semantic analysis to surface papers covering similar topics, even without explicit citation links — expanding search coverage beyond straightforward keyword matching.\n\nFor researchers tracking the output of specific academics, Google Scholar profiles allow individual scholars to maintain a public page displaying their publications, citation counts, and h-index. Following an author through Scholar triggers email alerts when new works by that author are indexed. This combination of broad search coverage, citation analysis, author tracking, and free access makes Google Scholar an indispensable tool in every researcher's workflow, even as newer AI-powered tools provide complementary analytical capabilities."

faqItems:
  - question: "Is Google Scholar free to use?"
    answer: "Yes — Google Scholar is completely free with no subscription or registration required. All search, citation tracking, and alert features are available at no cost."
  - question: "Does Google Scholar have full-text PDFs?"
    answer: "Google Scholar links to open-access PDFs and author preprints where available. Many journal articles are paywalled and only display abstracts unless you have institutional access."
  - question: "How is Google Scholar different from regular Google Search?"
    answer: "Google Scholar focuses exclusively on academic literature and ranks results by citation count and scholarly relevance rather than general web popularity, making it far more useful for research purposes."
  - question: "Can I set up alerts for new papers?"
    answer: "Yes — Google Scholar Alerts send email notifications when new papers matching your search query are indexed, keeping you current on emerging research without manual searching."
  - question: "What is an h-index in Google Scholar?"
    answer: "The h-index is a measure of a researcher's productivity and citation impact. It equals the number h such that h of their papers have each been cited at least h times — visible on individual Scholar author profiles."
  - question: "How accurate is Google Scholar's citation data?"
    answer: "Google Scholar citation counts are broadly accurate but can include self-citations and non-peer-reviewed sources. For rigorous bibliometric analysis, databases like Scopus or Web of Science provide more curated citation data."
