longDescription: "Reclaim AI is an intelligent calendar management platform that connects to Google Calendar and automatically schedules your tasks, habits, and meetings around your real priorities. Rather than manually blocking time and shuffling appointments, Reclaim uses AI to understand your preferences and workload, then dynamically arranges your week to protect the time that matters most.\n\nAt the heart of Reclaim is its smart scheduling engine. When you add a task — whether it's a deep work session, an administrative block, or a recurring habit like exercise or lunch — Reclaim finds the best available slot and inserts it automatically. If a meeting is booked over your focus block, Reclaim reschedules it intelligently rather than simply deleting it. This proactive rescheduling ensures your priorities stay intact even as your calendar fills up with new commitments.\n\nOne of Reclaim's standout capabilities is habit protection. Users can define recurring activities they want to protect — daily writing sessions, weekly reviews, team syncs — and Reclaim will defend those slots from meeting overruns and last-minute changes. The tool also integrates with task managers like Asana, Linear, Todoist, and Jira, automatically pulling in deadlines and creating calendar blocks that reflect your real workload rather than an optimistic estimate.\n\nFor teams, Reclaim provides meeting intelligence tools that identify the best shared times across multiple calendars without the usual back-and-forth scheduling friction. It analyses availability patterns, commute and break preferences, and work hour boundaries to suggest meeting slots that respect everyone's focus time. Whether you're an individual contributor protecting deep work or a manager coordinating a distributed team, Reclaim AI delivers a smarter, more intentional approach to time management that translates directly into higher productivity and reduced scheduling stress."
