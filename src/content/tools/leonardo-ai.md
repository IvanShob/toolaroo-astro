longDescription: "Leonardo AI is a powerful AI image generation platform that has rapidly established itself as a top choice for game developers, digital artists, and creative professionals who need consistent, high-quality visual assets at scale. Unlike many image generators that prioritize casual experimentation, Leonardo is purpose-built for production environments where visual consistency, stylistic control, and asset reproducibility are essential. The platform combines a rich model ecosystem with advanced generation features that set it apart from simpler tools.\n\nOne of Leonardo AI's most distinctive capabilities is its custom model fine-tuning system. Users can train their own AI models on a set of reference images, creating a personalized generation engine that consistently produces characters, environments, or styles that match a specific creative vision. This is particularly powerful for game development studios that need an entire asset library to share the same aesthetic, or for brands maintaining strict visual identity across marketing materials.\n\nLeonardo's Image Guidance tools — including ControlNet integration and image-to-image generation — allow artists to use existing sketches, poses, or reference photos to steer the AI output precisely. The Canvas Editor provides an in-browser workspace for extending images, removing objects, and adding elements through AI inpainting, making it a comprehensive image editing suite as well as a generation tool. The platform has also expanded into motion and video generation, allowing users to animate still images with short AI-generated video clips.\n\nThe platform operates on a token-based credit system with a free tier that renews daily, making it accessible for regular hobbyist use. Leonardo AI's direct affiliate program allows creators to earn commissions by referring new users to the platform. With its combination of professional-grade generation quality, model customization, and an active community sharing prompts and fine-tuned models, Leonardo AI stands as one of the most complete AI creative platforms available."
