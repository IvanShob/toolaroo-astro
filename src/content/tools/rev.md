whoIsItFor: "Rev is ideal for journalists, legal professionals, medical teams, researchers, and businesses where transcription accuracy is non-negotiable. Anyone who has been burned by AI errors in sensitive transcriptions — legal depositions, medical dictations, academic research interviews — will find Rev's human verification tier invaluable. Content producers and media teams that need both speed and reliability for subtitles and closed captions are also strong users."
longDescription: "Rev is a professional transcription service that offers both AI-powered automated transcription and human-transcribed options for users who need verified, high-accuracy output. Founded on the premise that transcription quality matters enormously in professional contexts, Rev has built a platform that serves both ends of the speed-accuracy spectrum — giving users the choice between fast, affordable AI transcription and slower but highly accurate human transcription for situations where errors are unacceptable.\n\nRev's automated AI transcription delivers fast turnaround at a low per-minute price, producing transcripts in minutes from uploaded audio and video files. The AI handles clear speech well, producing usable transcripts for interviews, podcasts, meetings, and lectures with reasonable accuracy. Real-time captions for live events and meetings are available through Rev Live Captions, which integrates with Zoom, Google Meet, and Webex to display live subtitles during video calls — particularly valuable for accessibility compliance and participants joining with hearing impairments or in noisy environments.\n\nFor content where accuracy is critical, Rev's human transcription service connects files with Rev's network of professional transcriptionists who produce verified, edited transcripts reviewed for accuracy. Human transcription is priced per minute and takes longer to deliver, but achieves accuracy rates that AI systems cannot match in challenging audio conditions — crosstalk, heavy accents, technical terminology, or low-quality recordings. Law firms, market research firms, and academic institutions rely on Rev's human tier precisely because the cost of errors in these transcripts can be significant.\n\nRev also offers closed captioning and foreign language subtitling services, covering over 15 languages for video content that needs to reach international audiences or meet accessibility requirements. The caption output can be formatted for SRT, VTT, or embedded into video files, covering the range of delivery formats that video production teams require. For media production companies and content studios managing large volumes of video content, Rev's API allows integration into video workflows for automated caption generation at scale."
