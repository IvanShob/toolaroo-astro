longDescription: "Aiva (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist) is one of the first AI music composition tools to receive legal recognition as a composer from SACEM, a major music rights society — a landmark achievement that established AI-generated music as a legitimate creative output. It generates original, high-quality music across genres and moods, making it popular with indie game developers, filmmakers, and content creators who need original scores without hiring composers.\n\nUsers can create music by selecting a style from over 250 genres, choosing a target mood, and setting the desired duration. Alternatively, users can upload an 'influence track' — any song they want the AI to take inspiration from — and Aiva will analyze its harmonic, rhythmic, and structural patterns to compose something in a similar style. This gives creators precise directional control over the output.\n\nAiva's strength lies in its cinematic and orchestral music generation. Unlike loop-based systems that assemble pre-existing fragments, Aiva composes genuinely original arrangements with proper musical structure — intro, development, climax, and resolution. This makes it suitable for serious creative projects where music quality directly impacts audience perception, such as documentary films, narrative games, and premium marketing videos.\n\nThe built-in multi-track editor allows users to adjust individual instrument layers after generation — raising the violin melody, reducing the percussion, or extending a specific section. MIDI and stem exports make it possible to import Aiva's compositions into any digital audio workstation (DAW) for further professional editing and mixing, bridging the gap between AI generation and human refinement.\n\nFor indie developers with no music budget, Aiva's free tier offers a taste of its capabilities, while the Pro plan provides unlimited generations with full commercial rights — making it cost-effective for projects that would otherwise require commissioning original music at significant expense."
