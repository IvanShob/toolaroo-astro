longDescription: "Consensus is a specialised AI research engine built to solve one of the biggest problems in modern information overload: finding trustworthy, evidence-backed answers quickly. Instead of searching blogs, forums, or unverified websites, Consensus scans thousands of peer-reviewed academic papers and extracts scientific findings in seconds. It's designed for students, researchers, healthcare practitioners, analysts, and anyone who wants reliable information rooted in published science.\n\nCompared to traditional AI assistants that rely heavily on internal training data, Consensus focuses exclusively on scientific literature. This includes journals, medical studies, clinical trials, psychology research, economics papers, biology findings, and high-quality academic sources. When you ask a question, the tool identifies relevant papers, analyses abstracts and full texts, and summarises the conclusions into clear, digestible insights.\n\nOne of Consensus's most impressive strengths is its ability to produce evidence summaries. The AI extracts statements of effect, evaluates the direction of findings (positive, negative, neutral), and presents a compact overview of what the research supports. This eliminates hours of searching, reading, and evaluating academic documents manually.\n\nAnother key feature is Consensus's quality filtering. It prioritises reputable journals, excludes low-quality content, and highlights methodological details like sample size, study design, and type of evidence. This helps users determine not only what the science says but also how strong the evidence is."
