whoIsItFor: "Notta is ideal for international organizations, researchers, journalists, and HR professionals who need accurate transcription across multiple languages and both online and in-person settings. It is especially useful for teams that require flexible transcription workflows — whether capturing live meetings, importing pre-recorded files, or documenting field interviews on mobile."
longDescription: "Notta is an AI-powered transcription and meeting notes platform that converts audio and video into accurate, searchable text. It supports real-time transcription during live meetings and audio file imports, making it versatile for a wide range of workflows — from corporate team standups to academic lectures and research interviews.\n\nWith support for 58 languages and particularly strong accuracy for non-English content, Notta is a preferred tool for international organizations and multilingual teams. The platform integrates with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Webex, and also accepts direct audio and video file uploads in formats including MP3, MP4, WAV, and M4A — covering virtually any recording workflow.\n\nNotta's AI post-processing transforms raw transcripts into structured meeting notes. It generates concise summaries, identifies action items and decisions, creates chapter markers for easy navigation, and highlights key terms and phrases. This automatic structuring saves significant time compared to manually reviewing and organizing long transcripts, especially for teams running multiple meetings per day.\n\nThe platform's export flexibility is a key advantage — transcripts and summaries can be sent directly to Notion, Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or PDF with a single click. This seamless handoff to existing documentation workflows means meeting notes appear in the right place for the right people without additional manual steps.\n\nNotta's mobile app extends transcription beyond the desk. Users can record in-person conversations, interviews, and presentations directly from their phones, with the AI transcribing in real time or after the fact. This makes Notta particularly useful for journalists, HR professionals, researchers, and field teams who need accurate records of conversations that happen outside of formal video meetings."
