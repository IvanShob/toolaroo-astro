whoIsItFor: "Amper Music is suited for content creators, video producers, and small businesses that need royalty-free background music for commercial projects without music production skills.

Teams looking for a straightforward AI music solution with a focus on commercial usability will find Amper's style library relevant."
longDescription: "Amper Music is an AI music composition platform that enables users to generate custom, royalty-free music tracks for videos, podcasts, games, and commercial productions without any musical expertise. The platform uses AI models trained on professionally produced music to compose original tracks in a variety of moods, styles, and tempos that users can customize to fit their specific project needs.\n\nUsers begin by selecting a musical style from Amper's library, which covers categories including corporate, cinematic, electronic, ambient, and urban. From there, parameters like mood, tempo, key, and track length can be adjusted to produce music that fits the intended emotional tone and timing requirements of the video or content piece. The AI generates an original composition that users can further refine by adjusting the intensity, switching instruments, or modifying the structure of different sections.\n\nAmper's original distinction was its focus on commercial viability and music quality. The platform's approach to AI music generation emphasized producing tracks that sound genuinely produced — with proper arrangements, mixing, and mastering — rather than the simplistic loops that characterized earlier AI music tools. This commitment to production quality made Amper popular with marketing teams and video producers who needed music that reflected professional brand standards.\n\nNoteably, Amper was acquired by Shutterstock in 2020, integrating its AI music generation technology into Shutterstock's broader creative content ecosystem. This integration means Amper's music capabilities are now part of Shutterstock's licensing model, and the standalone Amper Music platform has evolved accordingly. Users seeking AI music through the Shutterstock ecosystem can access Amper-powered capabilities alongside Shutterstock's extensive stock music and media library."
