longDescription: "Semantic Scholar is a free, AI-powered academic search engine developed by the Allen Institute for AI (AI2). With an index of over 200 million scientific papers spanning computer science, medicine, biology, physics, economics, and dozens of other disciplines, it is one of the most comprehensive open-access research tools available to students, academics, and knowledge workers worldwide. Unlike general search engines or even traditional academic databases, Semantic Scholar uses machine learning to understand the meaning, context, and relationships within scientific literature rather than relying on keyword matching alone.\n\nOne of the platform's most celebrated features is its TLDR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summaries. Using AI models trained specifically on academic text, Semantic Scholar automatically generates concise, one-to-two sentence summaries of papers that capture the core contribution and findings. This allows researchers to rapidly assess whether a paper is relevant to their work before committing to a full read — a significant time-saver when scanning dozens of results during a literature review. The AI summaries are remarkably accurate for a broad range of fields and are displayed directly in the search results.\n\nThe citation graph is another distinguishing capability. Semantic Scholar maps the citation relationships between papers — showing both what a paper cites and what papers have cited it — and uses this network to surface highly influential works, track research lineage, and identify emerging research clusters. The platform's influence scoring helps researchers distinguish foundational papers from peripheral references, enabling faster and more effective literature review strategies.\n\nSemantic Scholar also offers personalisation features through its free account system — users can save papers to reading lists, follow researchers and topics, and receive recommendations based on their research interests. The semantic search engine understands queries posed in natural language rather than requiring precise boolean syntax, making it accessible to researchers at all career stages. With an open API available for developers and institutions, Semantic Scholar also integrates into research tools, reference managers, and academic workflows across the global research community."

  - "Less advanced filtering than paid platforms like Scopus or Web of Science"
  - "No built-in reference manager export directly to citation tools"
alternatives:
  - name: Elicit
    reason: AI research assistant that answers research questions using papers as evidence sources
  - name: Consensus
    reason: AI search engine specifically designed to surface scientific consensus on questions
  - name: Google Scholar
    reason: Broad academic index with strong citation tracking and direct PDF links
faqItems:
  - question: "Is Semantic Scholar really free?"
    answer: "Yes — Semantic Scholar is completely free with no paid tiers. All features including AI summaries, citation analysis, personalisation, and the API are available at no cost."
  - question: "How current is the Semantic Scholar index?"
    answer: "Semantic Scholar indexes new papers continuously, with recent publications typically appearing within days to weeks of being uploaded to preprint servers or published in journals."
  - question: "Can Semantic Scholar find full-text PDFs?"
    answer: "Semantic Scholar links to open-access PDFs where they exist. For paywalled papers, it provides citation information and may link to author-uploaded preprint versions."
  - question: "What makes Semantic Scholar different from Google Scholar?"
    answer: "Semantic Scholar's AI-generated TLDR summaries, semantic understanding of queries, citation influence scoring, and structured citation graph analysis offer more intelligent research assistance than Google Scholar's primarily keyword-based approach."
