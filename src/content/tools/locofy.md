whoIsItFor: "Locofy.ai is ideal for front-end developers, design-to-development teams, and product agencies that use Figma and want to significantly reduce the time spent converting UI designs into code. It is particularly valuable for teams that deal with frequent design handoffs and want to accelerate prototype delivery, generate consistent component code, and reduce the boilerplate work that slows down frontend development cycles."
longDescription: "Locofy.ai bridges the longstanding gap between design and development by using AI to automatically convert UI designs from Figma and Adobe XD into clean, production-ready frontend code. For product teams where the design-to-development handoff has historically been a source of friction, delays, and miscommunication, Locofy dramatically accelerates the process by generating structured, maintainable code that developers can work with immediately.\n\nThe tool works as a plugin directly inside Figma, where designers can tag and configure components, define interactions, and set responsive properties before triggering code generation. Locofy's AI analyses the design structure, detects reusable components and design tokens, and outputs code in the user's chosen framework — including React, Next.js, HTML/CSS, and Gatsby. The generated code follows component-based architecture principles, meaning it is modular, readable, and extensible rather than a flat, unstructured dump of markup.\n\nOne of Locofy's most valuable features is its design system synchronisation. When a project uses consistent design tokens — spacing scales, type styles, colour variables — Locofy maps these to code-level constants and component props, keeping the output aligned with the original design system. This is particularly powerful for teams maintaining a component library, as updates to the design can propagate into code with significantly less manual effort. Responsive layout detection ensures that the generated code adapts correctly across breakpoints, reducing the post-generation adjustments developers typically face.\n\nFor teams scaling frontend development, Locofy reduces the time from completed design to deployable prototype from days to hours. While the generated code may still require developer review and refinement for complex interactions or business logic, the reduction in boilerplate and structural setup is substantial. With an active affiliate programme and strong community traction among Figma-heavy product teams, Locofy.ai has become a compelling option in the growing design-to-code AI space."

faqItems:
  - question: "What frameworks does Locofy support?"
    answer: "Locofy currently supports React, Next.js, HTML/CSS, Gatsby, and Vue, with additional frameworks being added based on user demand."
  - question: "Is the generated code production-ready?"
    answer: "The structural and component code is production-grade, but developers should review generated output, add business logic, and integrate APIs before deploying to production."
  - question: "Does Locofy work with design systems and Figma components?"
    answer: "Yes — Locofy detects Figma components and design tokens, mapping them to reusable code components and style constants that align with your existing design system."
  - question: "Can Locofy export directly to GitHub?"
    answer: "Yes — paid plans include direct GitHub repository export, allowing generated code to be pushed directly into version control without manual file management."
  - question: "Can designers use Locofy without developer involvement?"
    answer: "Yes — Locofy enables designers to generate and preview frontend code directly from their Figma files without needing to involve a developer for initial prototype builds."
  - question: "Does Locofy support responsive design?"
    answer: "Yes — Locofy automatically detects responsive layouts from Figma designs and generates code that adapts correctly across breakpoints, reducing post-generation developer adjustments."
