whoIsItFor: "Pitch is built for startup founders, product teams, and design-conscious professionals who need to create polished pitch decks and presentations collaboratively. It particularly suits companies already using Slack, Figma, or Notion who want a presentation tool that integrates into their existing workflow. Teams who create recurring presentations — weekly all-hands, investor updates, product reviews — will benefit most from Pitch's real-time collaboration and template library."
longDescription: "Pitch is a modern collaborative presentation platform designed for teams that care about both the quality of their slides and the efficiency of their creation process. It combines a clean, flexible slide editor with robust real-time collaboration features, AI-powered content generation, and a curated library of professional templates — making it a strong alternative to both traditional tools like PowerPoint and newer AI-first tools like Tome.\n\nThe platform's collaboration features are among its strongest assets. Multiple team members can edit the same presentation simultaneously, with real-time cursor presence similar to Figma or Google Docs. Comments can be left on specific slides or individual design elements, and presentations have version history that tracks the evolution of a deck across multiple editing sessions. Workspace templates allow teams to build a shared library of branded master slides that any team member can start from — ensuring visual consistency without redesigning from scratch for each new deck.\n\nPitch AI integrates generative capabilities directly into the creation workflow. Users can generate full slide content from prompts, rewrite existing text in different tones, generate image suggestions for visual enhancement, and create full outline structures from a brief description. This reduces the time from blank slide to first draft, especially for recurring presentation types like quarterly reviews or product roadmaps where the structure is known but content needs regular updating.\n\nFor startups, Pitch has built significant community features around pitch deck sharing and discovery. Users can publish presentations publicly, explore thousands of real pitch decks from funded startups for reference and inspiration, and track viewer engagement through presentation analytics. Analytics show who has viewed a presentation, when, how long they spent on each slide, and which slides generated the most repeat views — invaluable data for founders refining investor narratives before a funding round."
