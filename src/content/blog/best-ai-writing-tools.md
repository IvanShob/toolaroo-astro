## What to Look for in an AI Writing Tool

Before diving into our picks, here's what separates a great AI writing tool from a mediocre one:

- **Output quality**: Does the generated text sound human, or does it read like a robot wrote it?
- **Customization**: Can you train it on your brand voice or adjust tone?
- **Use case coverage**: Does it handle long-form articles, short copy, emails, and social posts?
- **SEO features**: Does it help you optimize for search intent?
- **Pricing**: Is the free tier useful, or is it just a teaser?
